# Weather app

This is a simple mobile app that gives the temperature of your location, and the description of the weather condition. It also gives the temperature and weather condition for subsequent hours of the day and subsequent days of the week for day and night

## Code base
The app was built using flutter framework and dart programming languages

## Design
The design of the is a single paged app that shows the temperature and description of the weather condition in one page. Here's the link to the UI which inspired me: https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpointsnorthstudio.com%2Fblog%2Fdeep-dive-if-we-designed-a-weather-app%2F&psig=AOvVaw1jCOzo9hdBJJDOnOrAHAOo&ust=1673302913209000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CBAQjRxqFwoTCNjl6Z-BufwCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE
